                    <h1>Hello!<br>My name is Mico Tongco!<br></h1>
                   
                    <p>
                        <br>A little tidbit about me is that I am currently 21 years old and a 2nd year student college student at Malayan Colleges Mindanao. I currently enjoy spending my time playing video games, reading manga, practicing my badminton skills. These are my hobbies that I generally grew up to love because they have got me through many troubling times. Everyday, I try to improve my skills in these activities. One thing I also like to do in my spare time and is practice developing games. I try to watch a lot of YouTube tutorials on how to create games. I work with multiple game engines to see which one I personally would like to stick with and spend my time learning. I always found it amazing and beautiful on how some game developers can really create such astounding and groundbreaking games. Another thing about me is I love to listen to music. My favorite genres are LoFi, metal, pop rock, pop, and synth music. Music helps me to keep my cool from time to time and helps me focus on a lot of things. So, that’s generally everything about me and I hope this will help you to get to know me more!

                    <p>
                        <br>My vision of my self in 30 years finally having a successful job while still being able to find time for myself. I also still like to be playing video games as it is my life. I do hope by this time I also have my own house where I can finally feel free and independent. I would also like to see by this time is my family leaving in a very comfortable home. My siblings would also have graduated and found a very stable job. I generally don’t like thinking about the future, but it wouldn’t be bad if all that I have said right here would become real.
